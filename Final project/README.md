#### Description:

Task Tracker is an invaluable web-based application meticulously crafted to empower users in the efficient management of their tasks. This lightweight project stands out for its user-friendly interface, facilitating the seamless addition, editing, and deletion of tasks. Each task is endowed with a title, a detailed description, and a status indicator, offering users the flexibility to categorize their tasks into various states such as "To Do," "In Progress," or "Done."

At its core, Task Tracker serves as a digital companion for users seeking a straightforward and intuitive solution to organize their daily responsibilities. The interface, characterized by its clean design, provides a clutter-free environment, ensuring users can effortlessly navigate and interact with the application. This design philosophy underscores our commitment to creating a tool that simplifies rather than complicates task management.

The application's versatility extends beyond its fundamental features. Users can not only add new tasks but also edit existing ones to reflect changes or updates. The deletion feature allows users to declutter their task list, eliminating completed or irrelevant items. Task Tracker's list view, a central element of the application, provides users with a comprehensive overview of all tasks, including their titles, descriptions, and statuses, facilitating quick and informed decision-making.

- **Edit Task:** Modify existing tasks to update details or change their status.
